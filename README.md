## Dependencies ##

- All dependencies used in this project was loaded from nuget packages, once you build the restore will get all needed DLL's. 
So you do not need to install or configure external references/Tools.

## Database ##

- I've used one .NET App Cloud plataform called Appharbor, and added the MongoDB (MongoLab) tool.
To execute the project you do not need to install/configure nothing, all the data is hosted on MongoLab Cloud, if you want to analyze the
data you can use my user created only for this project test:
